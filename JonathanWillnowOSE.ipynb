    "The data set is constructed using the Tracking Underreported Financial Flows (TUFF) methodology which codifies a set of open source data collection procedures in a systematic, transparent and replicable way. This methodology was developed by ...... in collaboration with AidData, a research lab at William & Mary and has been used many times (p.62). It enables us to identify detailed financial, locational and even operational informations about officially financed projects that are NOT recorded by the donors and lenders (here China) through the international reporting systems, like the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS) or the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the authors of the paper address the relevance of this methodology many times and the constructed data set is unique in its range and accuracy, we will explore the TUFF methodology further.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First Stage\n",
    "This represents the stage of primary data collection. All recorded projects of interest were collected. In parallel, potential projects at the donor/lender-recipient/borrower-year unit got identified and collected by a standartizied set of search querries. The database of choice for this dataset is the media database Factivia wich collects newspapers, radio and television transcript worldwide in 28 languages. This set of documents is then filtered using a machine learning algorithm, trained with large amounts of past identified and classified documents. A subset of documents is determined which are most likely to contain information on officially by china financed projects. Each object of the subset was then reviewed by the team and assessed whether it contained the information or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Second Stage\n",
    "The so gathered set of documents is then subject to a second review and augmention to validate/ invalidate it and potentionally add to the project informations in order to improve the accuracy and scope. This is performed by native speakers and language experts. For this specific dataset, the researchers also collected informations from entities like the private contractors of the projects, experts with specific tacit knowledge for specific projects and also involved external reviewers that did fildwork on a specific project or country. As a measure of validity, the researchers calculate sytematically triangulation and completness scores for each project. This triangulation and the related score achives a higher validity and reduced systematic risk, but also avoids the over-reliance on Factivia.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Third Stage\n",
    "The aim of this stage is to maximize the reliability and completeness of the records on the individual projects by quality assurance procedures. This involves the identification and correcting of inconsistent coding e.g caused by different categorized standarts, several de-duplication procedures and the vetting of each individual project record by higher ranking researchers as this whole process involves `HOWMANY?` researchers and assistants. All projects with poor records and relativly high transaction value get indentified by the triangulation and completeness scores and undergoe another review.\n",
    "Finally the constructed dataset gets peer-reviewed by internal and external reviewers. For this specific dataset, more than 30 external and interbal reviewers were involved.\n"
