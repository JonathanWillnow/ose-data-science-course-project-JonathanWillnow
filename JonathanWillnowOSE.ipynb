Other viewing options like _MyBinder_ or _NBViewer_ may have issues with displaying images or coloring of certain parts (missing images can be viewed in the folder [files](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-data-science-course-project-JonathanWillnow) on GitHub).\n",

    "##### Information about replication and individual contributions:\n",
    "\n",
